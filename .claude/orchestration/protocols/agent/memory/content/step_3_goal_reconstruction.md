# Goal Reconstruction

## Instructions

1. **Identify Primary Goal**
   - Extract the original task/request that initiated this workflow
   - Summarize in a single sentence what success looks like

2. **Map Active Subgoals**
   - List subgoals derived from the primary goal
   - Mark each as: active | blocked | resolved
   - Identify dependencies between subgoals

3. **Identify Constraints**
   - **Hard Constraints:** Must-satisfy requirements
   - **Soft Constraints:** Nice-to-have preferences
   - Note any constraint conflicts detected

4. **Establish Expected Outcome**
   - What should the completed agent have produced?
   - What deliverables indicate progress?
   - What knowledge advancement was expected?

## Goal Hierarchy Format

```
Primary Goal: [single sentence]
├── SG-1: [subgoal] [active|blocked|resolved]
│   └── Depends on: [dependencies if any]
├── SG-2: [subgoal] [active|blocked|resolved]
└── SG-3: [subgoal] [active|blocked|resolved]

Constraints:
- Hard: [must-satisfy items]
- Soft: [preferences]
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Primary goal articulated clearly
- [ ] All active subgoals identified with status
- [ ] Hard and soft constraints documented
- [ ] Expected outcome for this phase defined
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Progress Assessment
