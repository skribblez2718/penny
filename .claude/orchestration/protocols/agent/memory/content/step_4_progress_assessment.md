# Progress Assessment

## Instructions

1. **Compare Output to Expected Outcome**
   - Did the agent produce the expected deliverables?
   - Was there meaningful knowledge advancement?
   - Were constraints respected?

2. **Identify Progress Indicators**
   - Concrete artifacts produced
   - Questions answered
   - Unknowns resolved (check Unknown Registry)
   - Decisions made with justification

3. **Identify Stall Indicators**
   - Output repeats input without addition
   - Agent explicitly stated inability to proceed
   - Output significantly shorter than expected
   - Circular reasoning detected
   - Same errors repeated across invocations

4. **Calculate Progress Score**
   - **SIGNIFICANT:** Major advancement toward goal
   - **PARTIAL:** Some progress, gaps remain
   - **MINIMAL:** Minor progress, major gaps
   - **NONE:** No discernible progress

## Progress Evidence Template

```
Progress Made: Yes|No
Score: SIGNIFICANT|PARTIAL|MINIMAL|NONE

Evidence of Progress:
- [indicator 1]
- [indicator 2]

Stall Indicators:
- [indicator if any]

Subgoal Updates:
- SG-X: [now resolved|still blocked|new blocker]
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Output compared against expected deliverables
- [ ] Progress indicators documented with evidence
- [ ] Stall indicators documented if present
- [ ] Progress score assigned with justification
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Impasse Detection
