## Agent-Specific Considerations (Validation)

For validation work, pay special attention to:
- **Validation criteria** - what specific criteria must be checked
- **Pass thresholds** - what constitutes a passing validation
- **Remediation scope** - what can be fixed vs requires escalation
- **Verdict format** - GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL requirements
- **Evidence requirements** - what proof of validation is needed
