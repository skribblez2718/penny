# Criteria Loading and Framework Setup

## Extract Validation Requirements

From task context, identify:
- Explicit quality criteria and acceptance standards
- Implicit expectations based on domain and artifact type
- Compliance requirements and constraints
- Success thresholds and scoring mechanisms

## Establish Validation Framework

Actions:
- Map artifact to appropriate validation dimensions
- Select verification methods (tests, review, checklist, analysis)
- Define pass/fail thresholds with rationale
- Identify validation scope and exclusions

## Framework Documentation

```
ARTIFACT_TYPE: {type}
VALIDATION_DIMENSIONS: {list}
METHODS: {list}
THRESHOLDS: {criteria → threshold}
SCOPE: {in/out}
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Criteria extracted
