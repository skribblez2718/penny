| Wide | Broad landscape | Unknown unknowns likely |

### DEPTH: How deep to investigate

| Level | Description | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Surface | Key facts only | Time-constrained, simple |
| Standard | Good understanding | Most research tasks |
| Comprehensive | Exhaustive | Critical decisions |
