# Discovery Process

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Broad Scan

Survey the landscape to identify:
- Key themes and concepts
- Major options and alternatives
- Critical considerations
- Potential pitfalls

**Tools:** WebSearch, WebFetch, Grep (codebase), Read (docs)

### Phase 2: Targeted Deep Dives

Investigate critical areas in depth based on domain:

**Technical Domain:**
- Architecture patterns and trade-offs
- Performance characteristics and benchmarks
- Security implications and best practices
- Maintenance considerations
- Ecosystem maturity and community support

**Personal Domain:**
- Decision frameworks applicable
- Trade-off analysis methods
- Risk assessment approaches
- Personal fit considerations
- Long-term implications

**Creative Domain:**
- Techniques and methodologies
- Conventions and expectations
- Audience considerations
- Cultural context
- Innovation opportunities

**Professional Domain:**
- Market dynamics and trends
- Competitive positioning
- Regulatory landscape
- Industry standards
- ROI considerations

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference Verification

Compare findings across sources to:
- **Confirm facts:** Multiple sources agree
- **Identify controversies:** Sources disagree
- **Spot gaps:** Sources are incomplete
- **Detect bias:** Sources have conflicts of interest

### Phase 4: Pattern Recognition

Look for:
- Recurring themes across sources
- Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Best practices and success patterns
- Edge cases frequently mentioned

### Phase 5: Gap Identification

Explicitly note:
- What remains unknown or uncertain
- What couldn't be verified
- What requires specialized knowledge
- What needs user input

## Research Documentation
