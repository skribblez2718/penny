## Agent-Specific Considerations (Research)

For research work, pay special attention to:
- **Research scope boundaries** - what topics are in/out of scope
- **Source quality requirements** - academic, industry, or general sources
- **Depth of coverage** - quick overview vs comprehensive analysis
- **Recency requirements** - how recent must sources be
- **Conflicting information handling** - how to present contradictions
