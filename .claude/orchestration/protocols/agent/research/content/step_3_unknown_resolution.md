# Unknown Resolution

## Instructions

1. Check if task references unknown items from previous workflow steps
2. Prioritize resolving critical unknowns that block downstream work
3. Document new unknowns discovered during research

## Unknown Registry Review

Load and review Unknown Registry from task memory:
- Identify unknowns marked as RESEARCH-REQUIRED
- Prioritize by impact on downstream work
- Flag unknowns that may remain unresolved

## Priority Classification

| Priority | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| BLOCKING | Prevents any progress | Must resolve |
| CRITICAL | Affects major decisions | High priority |
| IMPORTANT | Impacts quality | Medium priority |
| MINOR | Nice to know | Low priority |

## Resolution Process

For each prioritized unknown:
1. Identify what type of information is needed
2. Determine best sources for that information
3. Note if resolution requires external input (user clarification)
4. Document resolution or mark as persistent unknown

## New Unknown Documentation

When discovering new unknowns during this step:
- Assign unique ID (U-{sequence})
- Classify by category (technical, business, user, external)
- Assess blocking impact
- Add to Unknown Registry

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Previous unknowns reviewed and prioritized
- [ ] Blocking unknowns identified
- [ ] Resolution strategy for each unknown documented
- [ ] New unknowns added to registry
- [ ] Ready to formulate research strategy
