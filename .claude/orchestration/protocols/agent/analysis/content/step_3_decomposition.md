# Analysis Framework Selection

## Instructions

1. Choose dimensions most relevant to the domain and task
2. Set evaluation criteria drawn from context
3. Determine appropriate granularity level

## Framework Dimensions

### Technical Domain
- **Complexity:** Structural, behavioral, integration
- **Dependencies:** Build, runtime, data, external
- **Quality:** Maintainability, testability, security
- **Performance:** Scalability, latency, resource usage

### Personal Domain
- **Impact:** Short-term, long-term, reversibility
- **Resources:** Time, energy, money, relationships
- **Alignment:** Values, goals, constraints
- **Risk:** Likelihood, consequences, mitigation

### Creative Domain
- **Structure:** Narrative, composition, flow
- **Engagement:** Hook, tension, resolution
- **Style:** Voice, consistency, originality
- **Audience:** Expectations, accessibility, impact

### Professional Domain
- **Strategic:** Alignment, opportunity cost, synergy
- **Operational:** Resource requirements, timeline, dependencies
- **Financial:** Cost, revenue, ROI, risk-adjusted return
- **Organizational:** Capability, culture, change management

## Granularity Selection

| Level | When to Use | Depth |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| High-level | Overview needed, time-constrained | Major components only |
| Standard | Most analyses | Components + key relationships |
| Detailed | Critical decisions, complex systems | Full decomposition |

## Criteria Documentation

Document chosen framework:
```
DOMAIN: {identified domain}
DIMENSIONS: {list of chosen dimensions}
CRITERIA: {evaluation criteria for each dimension}
GRANULARITY: {high-level|standard|detailed}
RATIONALE: {why this framework fits}
```
