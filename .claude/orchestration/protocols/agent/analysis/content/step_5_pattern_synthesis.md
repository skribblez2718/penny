# Synthesis of Findings

## Instructions

1. Prioritize insights by impact and actionability
2. Group related findings into coherent themes
3. Highlight critical discoveries that demand attention
4. Make non-obvious connections visible

## Prioritization Matrix

| Finding | Impact | Actionability | Priority |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| {description} | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | P0-P3 |

**Priority Definitions:**
- P0: Critical - blocks progress or major risk
- P1: High - significantly affects outcomes
- P2: Medium - improves quality/efficiency
- P3: Low - nice to know

## Thematic Grouping

Organize findings into coherent themes:

**Architecture/Structure Findings:**
- {related structural insights}

**Risk/Vulnerability Findings:**
- {related risk insights}

**Pattern/Optimization Findings:**
- {related pattern insights}

**Dependency/Integration Findings:**
- {related dependency insights}

## Critical Discoveries

Flag findings that demand immediate attention:
```
CRITICAL: {finding}
REASON: {why it's critical}
IMPLICATION: {what it means for downstream work}
ACTION: {what should be done}
```

## Non-Obvious Connections

Surface insights that aren't immediately apparent:
- Connections between seemingly unrelated components
- Secondary effects of identified issues
- Cascading implications
- Counter-intuitive findings

## Theme Summary

For each major theme:
```
THEME: {name}
FINDINGS: {count}
PRIORITY: {overall priority}
KEY INSIGHT: {main takeaway}
IMPLICATION: {for synthesis/generation}
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All findings prioritized
- [ ] Themes identified and findings grouped
- [ ] Critical discoveries highlighted
- [ ] Non-obvious connections surfaced
- [ ] Ready for output generation
