## Agent-Specific Considerations (Analysis)

For analysis work, pay special attention to:
- **Analysis framework** - what methodology should be used
- **Complexity metrics** - how complexity should be measured
- **Risk tolerance** - how conservative the analysis should be
- **Dependency scope** - how deep to trace dependencies
- **Trade-off priorities** - which factors matter most in comparisons
