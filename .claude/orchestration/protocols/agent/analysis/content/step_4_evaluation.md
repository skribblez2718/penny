# Analytical Process

## Substeps

### MAP: Document Components and Relationships

- Identify all relevant components/elements
- Document relationships and connections
- Visualize structure (even in text format)
- Note hierarchies and groupings

**Output Format:**
```
COMPONENT: {name}
TYPE: {category}
RELATIONSHIPS: {list of connections}
CRITICALITY: {HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}
```

### SCORE: Evaluate Against Criteria

For each dimension, evaluate with evidence:
- Assign scores with clear justification
- Reference specific evidence
- Note confidence level

**Scoring Scale:**
- SIMPLE/LOW: Straightforward, minimal concern
- MEDIUM: Moderate complexity/risk
- COMPLEX/HIGH: Significant attention required
- CRITICAL: Immediate action needed

### DETECT: Identify Patterns and Anomalies

Look for:
- Recurring themes across components
- Anti-patterns that indicate problems
- Optimization opportunities
- Structural anomalies
- Unexpected relationships

### CALCULATE: Assess Complexity

Multi-dimensional complexity scoring:
- Count components and connections
- Assess cognitive load
- Evaluate change impact radius
- Consider operational complexity

**Complexity Formula:**
```
OVERALL: {SIMPLE|MEDIUM|COMPLEX}
Components: {count}
Dependencies: {count}
Critical Paths: {count}
Change Impact: {LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}
```

### ASSESS: Evaluate Risks and Opportunities

For each identified risk:
```
RISK: {description}
LIKELIHOOD: {LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}
IMPACT: {LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}
MITIGATION: {possible approaches}
```

For each opportunity:
```
OPPORTUNITY: {description}
POTENTIAL: {value assessment}
EFFORT: {required investment}
```
