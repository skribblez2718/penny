## Agent-Specific Considerations (Generation)

For generation work, pay special attention to:
- **Target environment** - where the generated code will run
- **Testing requirements** - what test coverage is expected (TDD mandatory)
- **Security constraints** - what security patterns must be applied
- **Performance requirements** - any performance thresholds
- **Style/conventions** - coding standards to follow
- **Dependencies** - what libraries/frameworks are available
