# Strategic Question Formulation

## Actions

1. Design question sequences that build on each other
2. Prioritize questions by dependency and impact
3. Prepare follow-up questions for anticipated answers
4. Include assumption-validation questions
5. Plan edge case explorations

## Question Design Principles

### Dependency Ordering
- Foundation questions first (the "why")
- Structure questions second (the "what")
- Detail questions third (the "how")
- Edge case questions last (the "what if")

### Information Efficiency
- Each question should target ONE specific ambiguity
- Avoid compound questions that can be partially answered
- Frame questions so answers directly enable progress

### Anticipatory Design
- Consider likely answers and prepare follow-ups
- Design branching paths for different answer types
- Plan convergence points back to main line

## Question Categories

### Must-Ask (P0/P1 Gaps)
Questions that MUST be answered before any meaningful progress

### Should-Ask (P2 Gaps)
Questions that significantly improve quality of output

### Could-Ask (P3 Gaps)
Questions that refine details if time permits

## Formulation Templates

**Intent Questions:**
- "What is the fundamental goal of [X]?"
- "What problem does [X] solve?"
- "What does success look like for [X]?"

**Scope Questions:**
- "What is explicitly in scope for [X]?"
- "What is explicitly out of scope?"
- "Where are the boundaries of [X]?"

**Constraint Questions:**
- "What limitations exist for [X]?"
- "What resources are available?"
- "What deadlines or timelines apply?"

**Validation Questions:**
- "Is it correct to assume [Y]?"
- "Let me confirm: you're saying [Z]?"
- "Have I missed anything important about [X]?"

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Question sequences designed for each priority level
- [ ] Follow-up questions prepared for likely answers
- [ ] Assumption-validation questions included
- [ ] Question dependencies mapped
