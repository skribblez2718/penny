## Agent-Specific Considerations (Synthesis)

For synthesis work, pay special attention to:
- **Integration priorities** - what elements must be unified
- **Contradiction resolution** - how to handle conflicting inputs
- **Design constraints** - what limitations affect the synthesis
- **Output format** - how the synthesized result should be structured
- **Coherence requirements** - what must be consistent across the synthesis
