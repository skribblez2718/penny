# Synthesis Strategy Development

## Instructions

1. Enumerate all elements requiring integration
2. Map relationships, dependencies, and interaction patterns
3. Detect contradictions, conflicts, or tensions requiring resolution
4. Identify integration complexity and determine decomposition approach

## Element Enumeration

List all elements to integrate:
- Requirements
- Constraints
- Patterns/approaches
- Findings from research
- Dependencies from analysis

## Relationship Mapping

Document relationships between elements:
- Dependencies (A requires B)
- Conflicts (A contradicts B)
- Synergies (A enhances B)
- Neutrals (A independent of B)

## Contradiction Detection

For each detected conflict:
```
CONFLICT: {element A} vs {element B}
NATURE: {mutual exclusion | tension | resource competition}
RESOLUTION OPTIONS: {list possible approaches}
```

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All elements enumerated
- [ ] Relationships mapped
- [ ] Contradictions identified
- [ ] Integration strategy formed
- [ ] Ready for integration process
