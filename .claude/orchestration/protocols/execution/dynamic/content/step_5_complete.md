# Complete Workflow

Finalize the dynamic skill sequencing workflow.

## Instructions

Complete the workflow by:

1. **Summarize Execution**
   - List all skills that were executed
   - Note any that were skipped and why
   - Record final outcomes

2. **Compile Deliverables**
   - Gather all outputs from executed skills
   - Present final deliverable(s) to user
   - Ensure deliverables are clearly organized

3. **Capture Learnings**
   - If novel patterns emerged, consider invoking develop-learnings
   - Note any improvements for future similar tasks
   - Record any issues encountered for future reference

4. **Cleanup**
   - Mark workflow as complete
   - Archive memory files if needed
   - Clear any temporary state

### Output Requirements

Produce a completion summary:

```
DYNAMIC SKILL SEQUENCING - COMPLETE
====================================

Task: {original task description}

Skills Executed:
1. {skill-name}: {one-line summary of output}
2. {skill-name}: {one-line summary of output}
...

Final Deliverable:
{description of what was produced}

Learnings:
- {any notable learnings or "None"}

Status: COMPLETE
```

### Post-Completion

After completing this protocol, you may be prompted to:

1. **Invoke develop-learnings** if significant patterns were discovered
2. **Return to user** with the final deliverable
3. **Start new task** if user has additional requests

## Important Notes

- Ensure the user receives a clear summary of what was accomplished
- If the task resulted in artifacts (code, docs, etc.), point to their locations
- If any steps remain incomplete, clearly state what's pending
