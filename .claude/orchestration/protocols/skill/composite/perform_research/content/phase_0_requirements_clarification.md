# Phase 0: Requirements Clarification (MANDATORY)

**Uses Atomic Skill:** `orchestrate-clarification`
**Phase Type:** LINEAR (Mandatory)

## ENFORCEMENT

This phase ALWAYS executes. No skip conditions apply.
Clarification is essential for first-attempt success.

## Purpose

Transform ambiguous queries into explicit research scope using the Johari Window Discovery framework.

## Domain-Specific Extensions

When clarifying research requirements, specifically address:

1. **Research Question Extraction**
   - What is the core question to answer?
   - What specific aspects need investigation?
   - What would constitute a complete answer?

2. **Scope Definition**
   - What should be included in scope?
   - What should be explicitly excluded?
   - What depth of coverage is expected?

3. **Depth Level Inference**
   - quick: "quick look", "brief", "overview", "summarize"
   - standard: "research", "investigate", "analyze", "explore"
   - comprehensive: "deep dive", "comprehensive", "doctoral", "thesis", "literature review"

4. **Success Criteria**
   - What questions must be answered?
   - What level of confidence is required?
   - What format is expected for output?

5. **Source Preferences**
   - Are there specific source types required (academic, industry, official)?
   - Any source exclusions or restrictions?
   - Citation format preferences?

## Gate Exit Criteria

- [ ] Research question clearly defined
- [ ] Scope boundaries established (inclusions/exclusions)
- [ ] Depth level inferred or confirmed
- [ ] Success criteria documented
- [ ] Domain identified (technical/personal/creative/professional/recreational)
- [ ] Source preferences captured

## Output

Document clarified requirements in the clarification-agent memory file for use by Phase 1 (Parallel Research).

Include:
- **Research Question:** Clear statement of what to investigate
- **Scope:** Explicit inclusions and exclusions
- **Depth:** quick/standard/comprehensive
- **Success Criteria:** What constitutes a complete answer
- **Source Preferences:** Any requirements or restrictions
