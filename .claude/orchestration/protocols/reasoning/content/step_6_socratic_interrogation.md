# SOCRATIC SELF-INTERROGATION

Challenge the approach through systematic questioning.

## Instructions

Before finalizing the approach, ask and answer these questions:

### Clarity Questions
- **Are all terms and requirements clearly defined?**
  - Identify any ambiguous terms
  - Note any undefined requirements
  - Flag areas needing clarification

### Assumption Questions
- **What assumptions underlie my routing decision?**
  - List explicit assumptions made
  - Identify implicit assumptions
  - Assess which assumptions are risky

### Evidence Questions
- **What evidence supports this being the optimal path?**
  - What facts support this choice?
  - What experience informs this decision?
  - How strong is the supporting evidence?

### Alternative Questions
- **What alternatives exist and why are they suboptimal?**
  - List rejected alternatives
  - Explain why each was rejected
  - Note conditions that would change the ranking

### Implication Questions
- **What are the implications of this choice?**
  - What downstream effects follow from this decision?
  - What becomes easier or harder?
  - What risks does this introduce?

### Contradiction Questions
- **Are there any logical contradictions?**
  - Do any parts of the plan conflict?
  - Are there incompatible requirements?
  - Is the approach internally consistent?

### Blind Spot Questions
- **What perspectives or edge cases am I missing?**
  - What unusual inputs could break this?
  - What stakeholder perspectives haven't been considered?
  - What could go wrong that hasn't been addressed?

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- Answers to each question category
- Issues discovered through interrogation
- Adjustments needed based on findings
- Confirmation that approach survives scrutiny (or recommended changes)
