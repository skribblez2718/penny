# CONSTITUTIONAL SELF-CRITIQUE

Apply principled revision before execution.

## Instructions

Perform internal revision against core principles:

### 1. Review Initial Routing Decision
- Summarize the current routing decision and justification
- Note the confidence level from Step 5
- Consider issues raised in Step 6

### 2. Critique Against Principles

**Accuracy Principle**
- Is this the right tool for first-attempt success?
- Am I choosing based on actual fit, not convenience?
- Would a different approach have higher success probability?

**Completeness Principle**
- Have I considered all relevant factors?
- Are there requirements I've overlooked?
- Is the scope properly bounded?

**Clarity Principle**
- Is my reasoning transparent and justified?
- Could someone else follow my logic?
- Are all decisions traceable to requirements?

**Efficiency Principle**
- Am I using the most appropriate approach?
- Is the complexity proportional to the task?
- Am I avoiding unnecessary overhead?

### 3. Revise If Needed
- If critique reveals issues, adjust the routing decision
- Document what changed and why
- If no changes needed, confirm the decision stands

### 4. Re-Verify Before Proceeding
- Final confirmation that approach is sound
- Acknowledge remaining uncertainties
- Confirm readiness to proceed (or halt for clarification)

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- Critique results for each principle
- Any revisions made to the approach
- Final routing decision (confirmed or revised)
- Readiness assessment: PROCEED / REVISE / HALT
