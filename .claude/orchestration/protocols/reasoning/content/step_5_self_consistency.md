# SELF-CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION

Verify the routing decision through multiple reasoning chains.

## Instructions

Apply self-consistency checking:

1. **Generate Multiple Reasoning Chains**
   - Re-evaluate the routing decision from different perspectives
   - Consider: What would a cautious approach suggest?
   - Consider: What would an efficient approach suggest?
   - Consider: What would a thorough approach suggest?

2. **Identify Consistent Conclusions**
   - Compare the conclusions across reasoning chains
   - Note where all chains agree
   - Identify the most robust conclusion

3. **Flag Divergent Paths**
   - Where do reasoning chains disagree?
   - What causes the divergence?
   - Is the divergence due to different priorities or genuine uncertainty?

4. **Document Confidence Level**

   Select one:
   - **CERTAIN:** All reasoning chains converge on same conclusion
   - **PROBABLE:** Most chains agree, divergence is minor
   - **POSSIBLE:** Chains show significant variance, but one path is favored
   - **UNCERTAIN:** Chains diverge significantly, no clear winner

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- Summary of reasoning chains applied
- Areas of agreement across chains
- Areas of divergence with explanation
- Final confidence level with justification
- Recommendation: Proceed or reconsider?
