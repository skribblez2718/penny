# TREE OF THOUGHT EXPLORATION

Explore multiple solution approaches before committing.

## Instructions

Generate and evaluate alternative approaches:

1. **Generate Alternative Approaches (2 paths)**

   **Path A: Skill Orchestration**
   - Invoke a composite skill for multi-phase cognitive workflow
   - Structured phases: clarification → research → analysis → synthesis → generation → validation
   - Best for complex, multi-step tasks matching skill patterns
   - Best for system modifications (skills, agents, protocols)

   **Path B: Dynamic Skill Sequencing**
   - Orchestrator determines and invokes sequence of orchestrate-* atomic skills
   - Flexible cognitive flow for novel tasks
   - Best for tasks requiring multiple cognitive functions but not matching a composite skill
   - Best for tasks needing ad-hoc agent coordination

2. **Evaluate Viability**
   - Assess each path against the specific requirements
   - Consider complexity, risk, and resource requirements
   - Identify blockers or constraints for each path

3. **Compare Trade-offs**
   - What does each path optimize for?
   - What does each path sacrifice?
   - How does each path handle uncertainty?

4. **Select Optimal Path**
   - Choose the path with best risk/reward profile
   - Provide clear justification for selection
   - Document what would change the decision

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- 2-3 alternative approaches with descriptions
- Viability assessment for each
- Trade-off comparison
- Selected path with justification
