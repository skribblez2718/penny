# CHAIN OF THOUGHT DECOMPOSITION

Break down the problem into explicit logical steps.

## Instructions

Apply systematic reasoning decomposition:

1. **Problem Breakdown**
   - Divide the problem into distinct logical components
   - Identify dependencies between components
   - Determine the natural sequence of operations

2. **Show Internal Work**
   - Make each reasoning step explicit
   - Don't skip over intermediate conclusions
   - Document how each piece connects to the next

3. **Logical Connection**
   - Ensure each step follows logically from the previous
   - Identify any assumptions required at each stage
   - Note where uncertainty exists in the chain

4. **Transparent Reasoning**
   - Make the full reasoning path visible
   - Highlight key decision points
   - Document alternative interpretations considered

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- The decomposed problem components
- The logical sequence from problem to solution
- Key assumptions at each stage
- Areas of uncertainty or multiple valid interpretations
